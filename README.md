Scrapper for Japanese Lessons to store them offline

Don't you hate it when you can't read your japanese lesson on the train because there are no network available?
Yeah. I do too.

This script allows you to easily download nihongoshark's email lessons for you to read them anywhere.
Beware though, images are not downloaded.
